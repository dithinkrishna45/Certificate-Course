#Tuple Project â€“ Library Book Tracker
# Problem:
# Use tuples to represent books in a library.
# Each book = (BookID, Title, Author, Year)
# Store multiple tuples in a list.
# Allow user to:
# Search book by ID or Title
# Display all books published before a given year
# Count how many books each author has
