# Create a simple movie recommendation system using sets.
# User A’s watched movies (set1)
# User B’s watched movies (set2)

#Tuple Project – Library Book Tracker
# Problem:
# Use tuples to represent books in a library.
# Each book = (BookID, Title, Author, Year)
# Store multiple tuples in a list.
# Allow user to:
# Search book by ID or Title
# Display all books published before a given year
# Count how many books each author has

# Create a grocery billing system using lists.
# Have two lists: items = ["milk","bread","egg"] and prices = [40,25,5].
# Ask user to enter what items they bought and quantity.
# Calculate total bill.
# Apply discount:
# 10% if total > 500
# 20% if total > 1000
